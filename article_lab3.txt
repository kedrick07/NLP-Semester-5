KIDNAPPING GANG BUSTED, HANDGUNS, POLICE UNIFORMS SEIZED IN CAMBODIA

PHNOM PENH: Eight Cambodian men have been arrested and four handguns
seized in connection with impersonating law enforcement officers to
kidnap and extort money from multiple foreign nationals in Phnom Penh.

The Phnom Penh Police busted the gang, who disguised themselves as
police officers to detain foreigners and extort money from them
several times at various locations across the capital.

In the latest case, the suspects allegedly kidnapped a Chinese
national at 3.20am on Nov 5, before extorting more than US$50,000,
according to a Nov 21 National Police statement.

The victim, a 29-year-old Chinese man named Long Jun, lived at a condo
in Boeung Keng Kang district, according to the police.

On Nov 19, the Phnom Penh Criminal Police Department, in cooperation
with the 14 district police in Phnom Penh and the police units in
Kandal, Takeo, Kampot, Siem Reap and Preah Sihanouk provinces,
launched a coordinated investigation which led to the arrest of eight
suspects.

“Based on their confessions, the eight suspects admitted to carrying
out six confirmed cases of kidnapping and extortion,” it stated.

Seized evidence included two Prius cars, four handguns (two Glock 19s,
a Sig Sauer and a Springfield Armory) with 38 rounds, six mobile
phones, 7 pairs of handcuffs, four Royal Gendarmerie uniforms and two
copies of Gendarmerie ID cards.

Four of the eight suspects were reportedly employed as drivers for
Chinese clients.

It was not immediately clear if the men they robbed were their
employers. The suspects are currently being processed by the Criminal
Police. - The Phnom Penh Post/ANN
