        "Let’s take a simple example of finding minimum edit distance between\n",
        "strings `ME` and `MY`. Intuitively you already know that minimum edit distance\n",
        "here is `1` operation and this operation. And it is replacing `E` with `Y`. But\n",
        "let’s try to formalize it in a form of the algorithm in order to be able to\n",
        "do more complex examples like transforming `Saturday` into `Sunday`.\n",

        "transform last letters `E → Y`. So minimum edit distance of `ME → MY` transformation\n",
